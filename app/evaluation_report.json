      "question": "Why is standby instrumentation critical in case of Air Data Computer failure?",
      "answer": "Standby instrumentation is critical in case of Air Data Computer (ADC) failure because it provides a backup system for essential flight parameters, such as altitude, airspeed, and vertical speed. In the event of an ADC failure, the standby instruments can take over and provide accurate readings to the pilots, ensuring safe flight operations.\n\nWithout standby instrumentation, the pilots would be reliant on the failed ADC for critical flight information, which could result in errors or unreliable data. This could potentially lead to loss of situational awareness, difficulty in navigating, and increased workload for the pilots, all of which can compromise safety.\n\nMoreover, standby instruments can also provide a means of diagnosing the cause of an ADC failure, allowing maintenance personnel to repair or replace the failed component more efficiently.\n\nIn summary, standby instrumentation is essential in ensuring the safety and reliability of flight operations by providing a backup system for critical flight parameters in case of ADC failure.",

      "question": "Explain the use of the Machmeter in high-altitude flight.",
      "answer": "The Machmeter is used to indicate the Mach number of an aircraft in high-altitude flight. It consists of a simple aneroid altitude capsule and an airspeed capsule connected at the ratio arm. The instrument displays the indicated Mach number based on the expansion or contraction of the capsules due to changes in airspeed and altitude. The Machmeter does not suffer from temperature or density errors, but it can be affected by position error caused by disturbed airflow at the pitot head and/or static vent. In high-altitude flight, the Machmeter can undergo instrument, position, and manoeuvre induced errors, which can become dangerous if the sign of the position error is such that the Machmeter under-reads. To address this issue, modern jet aircraft use careful design and positioning of the pressure sources to minimize position error at low Mach numbers. However, at higher Mach Numbers, changes in airflow may cause position error to become bigger and possibly change its sign, which can lead to dangerous readings if not corrected.",

      "question": "Why is standby instrumentation critical in case of Air Data Computer failure?",
      "answer": "Standby instrumentation is critical in case of Air Data Computer (ADC) failure because it provides a backup system for essential flight parameters, such as altitude, airspeed, and vertical speed. In the event of an ADC failure, the standby instruments can take over and provide accurate readings to the pilots, ensuring safe flight operations.\n\nWithout standby instrumentation, the pilots would be reliant on the failed ADC for critical flight information, which could result in errors or unreliable data. This could potentially lead to loss of situational awareness, difficulty in navigating, and increased workload for the pilots, all of which can compromise safety.\n\nMoreover, standby instruments can also provide a means of diagnosing the cause of an ADC failure, allowing maintenance personnel to repair or replace the failed component more efficiently.\n\nIn summary, standby instrumentation is essential in ensuring the safety and reliability of flight operations by providing a backup system for critical flight parameters in case of ADC failure.",
